# Recursive Bouncy Ball Simulation

A simple Python program that demonstrates recursion by simulating a bouncing ball’s motion and energy decay.

## How It Works
- Uses recursion to simulate each bounce until velocity or height fall below a threshold.
- Optionally visualized using matplotlib or turtle (depending on version).
- Shows how recursive functions can model physical systems elegantly.

## Run It
```bash
python bouncy_ball.py
